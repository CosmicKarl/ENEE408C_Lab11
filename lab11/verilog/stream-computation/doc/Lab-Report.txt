Lab Report

	This lab was something of a struggle for the three of us. We had
difficulty understanding the high level LIDE_V concepts for most of
our time spent on this project. But once we understood the high level
and it was time to implement everything we struggled to move data
around between the 3 FSM modules. Even getting anything to compile 
was difficult because it was hard to understand anything in the
example. The FIFO objects were poorly documented in their source files
and the variable names in the inner product modules weren't very helpful.

	Other classes unfortunately had major deadlines just before this project
was due, which made it difficult to put an appropriate amount of time into
understanding the material for this lab.

	However, this being our second project, we've gotten much more
comfortable using source control. There was very little stepping on each
other's toes this time and it felt more natural dividing up the work this
time around
